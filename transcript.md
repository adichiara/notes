 It's fine.
 For you, for you, okay?
 Thank you.
 Oh, sorry.
 Hello. Hi.
 Sorry.
 I think I caught some like, feet splashes or anything.
 Nah, that was probably my hand.
 We forgot to put our webcam on here.
 Okay, sounds good.
 Is Abby at school today?
 She had a two hour delay.
 What about for you guys?
 One of my kids is home, and the other two went to Mexico.
 I bet.
 After vacation, like enough already.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Yeah, it's not really necessary. I feel like the brothers are fine.
 Probably was fine.
 Yeah.
 Anyways, good to see you both.
 Interesting, yeah.
 So how was the trip? How was the birthday?
 I guess I should just generally start out. Where do you guys want to start?
 I'm curious. That's my need, not yours.
 It ended up being fine. It ended up being good.
 So, yeah.
 We ended up, we didn't really get to talk to her.
 Like, we had time, like for me to talk and, you know, for us when we were all together.
 Just because like, there wasn't a good time.
 And then she kind of seemed fine with it.
 And so we're like, let's just let her go and sort of like making a big deal out of it.
 And, you know, they went, they said, Adam texted me in the middle of it and said they're doing good.
 And they, you know, had a good time.
 And even like I looked at pictures after, you could tell Abby looked happy.
 So like that was good.
 And yeah, and I still haven't, I still want to like address those things that like I had mentioned that, you know, we were going to talk about.
 But I just, it hasn't happened yet, you know.
 But yeah.
 Yeah. I mean, I thought we had a nice day there.
 You know, on the write up, I just briefly, you know, said to Abby, you know, like I always do, you know, let me know how you're feeling while we're there.
 And I said, you know, I'm just going to say something, you know, that you're uncomfortable about.
 You know, we have a little color code and she kind of works into like conversation like red or yellow, you know, depending on how, what level of uncomfortable she's feeling.
 And it's kind of good just to give her that, you know, and so that we can kind of touch base.
 But she seemed pretty okay with it, you know, and I, you know, she seemed to have a nice time there.
 And like, it was just my parents and I was an Abby, so it was, you know, quiet and I was saying to Kelly, that's kind of how things are now.
 Like, I know in the past, you know, things have been a little bit more, you know, lively.
 But, you know, when it's smaller groups and especially now with how my mom is doing, I think it's a little bit more subdued.
 And, you know, that actually works out better for Abby too, you know.
 But yeah, I mean, she, you know, she was, you know, kind of talkative, you know, I think there's sort of a level of like politeness, you know, there, which is fine, you know.
 But, you know, she was just showing like some maturity.
 I just felt like she was being pretty mature and, you know, wasn't really in a rush to leave.
 In fact, I think we stayed like over three hours.
 And, you know, there was like certain sort of a point in time where I thought, OK, this could be a cool time to get out if we need to.
 But Abby was kind of in the middle of doing something with my mom and she seemed into it and it was kind of good.
 So we just kind of, you know, let that go.
 At the end, she actually gave them a hug each.
 And, you know, my dad, she hasn't done hugs with anybody in a long time.
 And, you know, they are always sort of just kind of feeling her out.
 So to say, you know, is this a hug situation?
 Just to see, you know, and in the past, Abby's been, you know, no, I'm not comfortable yet.
 And we're like, OK, this time, you know, Abby, like, OK.
 And of course, they melted with that, you know, and so I know that was a big deal for them.
 And afterwards, I feel that way.
 I was like, I was kind of surprised, you know, I thought it was really nice, but I was kind of surprised, you know, was that something you're comfortable with now?
 Or, you know, she's like, and she said, you know, it's not something I might always want to do, but I was comfortable today.
 And, you know, it's having a really nice time.
 And I just know how, you know, how much they wanted to give me a hug.
 And I think she also felt like special because it was for her birthday.
 And there's some things she said about that, too.
 So, you know, it was kind of a nice day.
 So, Kelly, what's it like for you?
 I mean, being on the outside, kind of looking in on this.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I was just like happy for them, you know, like that they got a nice visit, that like it was enjoyable and fun and they both had a good time.
 So I just kind of felt like glad for them, you know, I was like, I know the last session, like, I'm so bad with the communication and I know I didn't really address.
 I started like off on something else.
 I didn't really address, like, you know, for Adam how I feel, you know, where he's not able to do some things with his family, you know, like that whole thing.
 And so I really was like so happy for Adam that like he was able to get that experience and know that was super important for him.
 And I know like when he said that he saw Abby and Marie, his mom was doing this little sticker activity, like I was glad for him that like he saw like Abby enjoying herself, you know, because I know he was saying like, oh, she's not going to have those memories,
 those like happy, positive memories with her grandparents.
 And like she had, you know, she had one and I was glad he got to see it, that it was like sooner rather than later, you know, that they were able to have a good time.
 And so I was like super happy for Adam that he got that, you know, you know, I was glad for Abby that, you know, when I saw like her picture that she was relaxed and happy, you know, so that was good.
 And yeah, I was just happy for them.
 I, you know, like I just, yeah, with the whole like hug thing, I just like I feel bad because like I hope she, I know, you know, like I just want her not to ever feel like I gave the hug because I know they wanted it, you know, like I, it seems like she did because she probably wouldn't have done it if a part of her didn't want it to, you know.
 But I just, I hope, you know, in the future, you know, she doesn't feel pressure, you know, to do that all the time.
 So, like I just, I want to like, I mean, it's just something so little, but I want to like convey or relay that to her somehow down the road, like, you know, do what, you know, do what is right for you, you know, like it's so hard, so confusing and touchy.
 But like, you know, where she was like, oh, I gave them a hug because I knew they wanted it, you know, like, oh, I just don't want her to like get into that.
 But, but overall, I was glad I was glad for Adam that like they gave each other a hug, you know, like I was just like, overall, just seem like very positive.
 So it was good.
 Yeah, I mean, for you, though, I didn't hear what you felt.
 I guess just happiness that like it was a good event overall, you know, like I didn't have to go. They got to go and have fun.
 Yeah, I don't know.
 What do you think, Adam?
 Yeah, I mean, I just to go back with the Abby feeling pressured thing, I did ask her about that and she said she didn't, you know, I said, Did you feel pressure at all?
 I just want to, you know, address that and not make her feel like she can't bring it up if that was the case.
 But she was like, No, I think she just genuinely wanted to that day and, you know, was OK with it.
 You know, I think on both sides, like she my parents had given her a necklace.
 Yeah, that is true. And she immediately just kind of put it on. Yeah.
 My mom started crying just watching that, you know, and a little bit in a nice way.
 But and Abby wore it all the way home and, you know, coming in and was showing Kelly.
 You know, that kind of stuff was really nice.
 So it just showed me, I think, you have to do this more often.
 You know, I mean, it was not the kind of thing that.
 You know, added stress to her, I think it was just in Abby's case, something that was another step towards, you know, in the right direction, both for her, for me, my parents and, you know, for me and Kelly, too.
 So to me, it just was more, you know.
 Of a sign that this is something that we should be doing more often.
 Yeah, sounds like it was like controllable, like circumstances, you know, having the smaller group and just, you know, a lot of preparation and containment and just kind of support and, you know, seem to help.
 So are you guys fine with this being the dynamic? Like, what do you think?
 I mean, I'm glad it was successful. That's wonderful.
 You know, like, let's celebrate all that, you know, and also look to the future and kind of like, what are some feelings that are maybe not explored as much that this might be a good time to think about?
 I mean, I think the thing is that Kelly isn't there, you know, and so what does that mean going forward? And when, you know, like we talked about this a lot, that, you know, I don't want, you know, Kelly's situation is different than Abby's and, you know, I don't want her to feel out of pressure to be there when she's uncomfortable or whatever.
 But that's just, you know, what I feel is like, you know, it's obvious, you know, she's not there.
 I don't like the feeling of being like, you know, feeling like anything with my side of the family and Abby is like, you know, something like a couple that's separated would have, you know, where on one weekend, you know, father has, you know, kids and they go do their stuff and other times it's the other way around.
 I mean, that's just, I wasn't thinking about it that way, but it kind of like sometimes feels like that, you know, and has in the past, but, you know, at the same time, I, if that's right now, that's what works, I guess, is what is for everybody is that.
 But I don't see that as like the long term, you know, permanent state. I think at some point it would be great to do stuff with Kelly there too, but it doesn't mean it has to be all the time either, you know, so I don't know.
 Like baby stuff, right?
 Yeah, I guess.
 Yeah. What do you mean you guess?
 I think a few weeks ago when we were talking about that, one thing in the future we were looking at, and Kelly was like, I don't see the point of even doing baby stuff, because I never see myself doing holidays and things like that in the future.
 And so, you know, why put all the work and effort into, you know, little by little if I really never want to be going to other things.
 I guess.
 I think we were talking about, like you said, I'm never going to want to do Thanksgiving at Jason and Kathy.
 Yeah, it's just that that scares me.
 Yeah, legit, like put that out there Kelly, for sure.
 That's got a lot of components to it.
 You think about like exposure, you know, it's kind of like the top of the heap in terms of like goals.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think for me it's just so hard. It's like, yes, you know, like the, you know, the goal is to be able to like go there and hang out and, you know, again, not every time but like be able to and here and there and have an enjoyable time and that is a cool goal.
 You know, that would be awesome.
 I would like that. However, it's just, it's so hard for me to see myself going and it being positive and good.
 It's hard. It's like, yeah, I guess, you know, I would want to be there for for Adam and for Abby, and to have like a cohesive family unit going, you know, but I just don't see why I need to be there.
 Like, because I don't see. I know they don't want to hang out with me. And I know it would be awkward. And I know it would be like fake, you know, I think I have a hard time with like, you know, I feel like I'm different now and it would be so in the whole situation is so different.
 And it'd be so fake, you know, because we're all trying to be polite, and we all know it's like, it's not cool. And I mean like they just said like, you know, okay, they're like sitting around the table and like, you know, having food.
 And then like, you know, Abby went and did like a little sticker thing with his mom and then why they were doing that Adam played like backgammon with his dad and I'm just like, you know, like, the exactly.
 Yeah, it just seemed way more enjoyable for all four people. Yeah, if I wasn't there, you know, and it's just like, you know, all they want to see is all they want to see is like, you know, like, I'm not going to be there.
 And all they want to do is hang out with Adam and Abby and catch up with them. Right. I mean, I know, okay, I'm like the daughter in law, they want to be polite and like before, and like, how are you doing, blah, blah, blah.
 But like, all they really want to do is hang out with Abby and all they really want to do is hang out like with Adam and, you know, why.
 I don't know.
 I think you're just feeling like, what is my role here. They don't want me anyway, like, you know, there's a lot of feelings there I would think, and that's really, yeah, I would say what the feelings are that you feel around feeling like you're not wanted.
 I don't know I think I'm just like what's the point and, you know, like,
 like kind of resigned or given up.
 Um,
 no, I like,
 yeah, I mean,
 I don't know if this is answering the question or if I even like know what my feelings are just like I know like, I feel like it's what's the point but like, I just
 like, I don't know a couple weeks ago Adam, I guess had said that his therapist asked him, you know, a question that Adam could ask me is like, do you want to be accepted by his parents.
 And I feel like and I never really answered him but like I was thinking about it and I feel like I don't, I don't want to be accepted I at this point I don't care, or, you know, it's not important to me because I know that I'm not going to be accepted for all these
 years. I haven't been accepted, and I can't imagine, you know, like he mentioned it like they're not going to change. So what is the point in me doing like a hamster race, like trying to get them to accept me or put in all drain my energy to try to get them to accept me.
 When I don't think it's going to happen, and I'm accepting that they're not going to accept me and so I would love to get to a place where for Adam and for Abby, that we are able to go in.
 You know, it seems like I would like to get to a place for Adam and for Abby to go as a family unit, but it's also kind of like it's for them, you know, just so they can see that I'm there but like I just think it's the relationship that with Joe Marie is just so different now,
 you know, and, and I, I feel like for so much, they've blamed me like, Oh, Abby's not doing whatever because Kelly's there and she's, you know, and so I feel like I don't want to put one more thing for them to blame me about, you know, so fine you guys, the four of you hang out, and you have fun I don't want to hear anymore that like,
 Kelly was there and I didn't get to hug her Kelly was there and she didn't feel like hugging it must have been Kelly so I'm like you guys just do your thing.
 Yeah, like I was thinking about the book, the whole new book and I feel like it's almost like you're in the withdraw pattern with them you know like you're like I'm, it's like a free them to you like I'm done.
 I mean, I know that you're like, lots of attempts that haven't worked, you know that people get to the stage. Yeah. You know, but I would like to hear from you, Adam like what your thoughts are on where Kelly stands right now.
 I hear her saying all that, and I think the thing to me the most is that she's saying I know they think this I know they feel this about me I know, you know, and I, I don't always agree with that, you know, I think, you know, I'm not saying, you know,
 I know how she feels I know that she feels how she feels for a reason.
 But, you know, I don't think, you know, I don't know she also. These are things that she is not hearing directly from them ever you know or.
 So, I don't know, to me, I, I feel like there's a lot of negative feelings and I think it's very easy for those to kind of snowball in your head.
 I'm not saying, you know, my parents are perfect or whatever and I'm not saying they. I don't know what they think I just am telling you, you know that it sounds like when you're assuming the worst of people, and how they think about you, how can you possibly repair them.
 How could you possibly repair any kind of relationship with that. If that's what you think. And, you know, I, I don't know, I mean to me it's hard to hear that stuff.
 Because
 I feel like, you know, you know Kelly feels how she feels for a reason she's not making up, you know, but I also, you know, feel like there's two sides to it, you know, my parents point of view would be, you know, Kelly's withdrawn so many for so long, hasn't, you know, come to things and hasn't said, you know, two words has looked like she doesn't want to be there.
 And so, from their point of view they would feel like she's pushing them away, you know, or not, you know, accepting them.
 You know, and so I don't, you know, if I was a fly on the wall from the whole thing maybe I would have a better, you know, picture of it but I can only know what I see and I hear from Kelly and my parents say, you know, I don't know, I think what Kelly says is too, too far.
 I don't really agree that they don't accept her like that. I think they accepted her from the start, you know, very early on.
 Things have maybe damaged that over time but I don't think she ever had to work to be accepted, you know, I think, you know, my parents welcome her and so I think now, you know, there's, yeah, like she says a feeling of a lot of stuff that we're not doing or, you know,
 ways that they feel disrespected or not understanding why we're not doing certain things and that kind of stuff has really taken a toll all around.
 But yeah, I feel like, you know, the whole idea of them, you know, it would be fake. I know they don't want me to be there. I know they wish it was just Abby and Adam. I just think that's, you know, creating, like I know you feel that but I think you're, you know, sometimes it can always be like telling a story, you know, putting things out in your head and, you know, I don't think it's fair.
 Yeah, I guess what came up for me, Kelly, when you were explaining it and you were saying like I can't work so hard to make them like me and what came to me was do you want to work to accept them or does that feel too much? Like, because that's in your control.
 Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, I mean, I don't know. It's a good question and it's like complicated and it's like, yeah, it's just so hard. It's like, where do you go from here? You know, like, it's just like, I,
 yeah, I mean, they did accept me in the beginning, you know, they welcomed me in. But then I think, as they didn't accept me as like a whole person, you know, as the years went by, and as I'm different, you know, then it was just like, okay, no, you know, this, again, like not fitting into the image I had.
 And so with all these things that happen, and like, I know, like, it could look like, or for it to be like, oh, Kelly's not coming, Kelly doesn't want to see, whatever, but like, I don't, like, I wonder if they ever see the role that they played in all of this playing out.
 And it's hard, I guess, for me to not have that narrative in my head, because I have, it's been a pattern. It's not like a couple instances, it's like this is consistently how it's been, year after year. And so, I mean, I guess, yeah, how would I accept them?
 Like, I think that would be baby steps, because I can't just be like, that's who they are, like, that's, okay, I'm just gonna, like, because it's been really hurtful for me, how they are. So like, yeah, I don't, so it's just tricky, you know, like.
 So what gets in the way of you accepting them for who they are is that it's been very hurtful. Can you articulate what exactly has been very hurtful for you?
 Not understanding and respecting me or listening to me, or like through Adam, you know, a lot of it hasn't come through me because I didn't feel it was my place, you know, so it came more through Adam, which is so many times with like, you know, with Abby and me trying to be a mom and having some, you know, wishes or some, you know, rules and dismissed.
 And me with my health and like so many times dismissed that Kelly's Crohn's isn't important, Kelly's symptoms aren't important, that like, I think that those were the things.
 And so it's hard for me to just be like, you know what, I accept that like, that's just how you guys are because it doesn't help me.
 It like, hurt me, like literally, you know, so it's really, I mean, like, so I want to get to a place where once I'm more myself and stronger, I can stand up for myself and go to these things and not be damaged or by how they are.
 Or if I don't feel comfortable or if I don't feel safe that I can stand up for myself or, you know, exit from, you know, but like, it's, I think it's hard to just be like, you know, I'm going to just accept you guys and like, okay, this is you, you know,
 it's been really damaging for me throughout the years.
 So the things that I heard were parenting, like their choices of parenting, Abby, like, and your Crohn's, like you felt like they kind of did not really see that in its entirety for how much of a challenge it is for you.
 And Adam said it repeated times, and they just didn't, you know, yeah, didn't accept it and then COVID hit.
 It sounds like you just haven't been seen in a way that feels good for you by his family. And it's like the role that you've fallen into doesn't feel comfortable. Right? So it's easy to avoid it.
 You want your tendency is to want to avoid it.
 Right.
 Like, just like one example is like, okay, so like for me, or I'm somebody who, okay, like, what's like the whole COVID thing like if I'm just gonna be like, okay, I accept you guys like it's like the Italian thing that you're used to like just like everybody gets together everybody comes out.
 That was hard because that negatively affects my health with COVID, you know, like, it's hard to just be like, okay, fine, we'll just do the Italian thing, like, we're all gonna get together and hug and kiss and whatever.
 Like hug and, and it's like just because like that, what they're used to, I feel like it's hard for me to accept that because it wasn't healthy for me. And then it's also like, just because I'm different.
 You know, it's not that I'm wrong. It's just, you know, that, you know, so it's like, why.
 It's hard when it's like those difference was one thing when those differences are just like, okay, yeah, it was a lot to go to all these parties, you know, but it's like, I did it and it was always a thing because it was just like it wasn't negatively affected like getting
 sick, kind of, you know what I mean. And then it was like a different ballgame like level when it was like COVID was like okay no by hanging out with like everybody and like all this pressure to do stuff and feel guilty and everything that is not healthy.
 So, there was a good difference that I don't know if I'm explaining this or answering what you were
 saying.
 And so, I think it's actually, it's kind of two different things, you know, there she has Crohn's right and obviously with COVID a lot of health concerns a lot of, you know, need to be extra careful.
 You know, she's acknowledged she also has a lot of anxiety related to her health.
 And she's always been in the compromise with this but, you know, and being around people who are sick is something that you have to be a little more concerned about. But there was another level to that, you know, due to the added anxiety and it's all understandable.
 You know, given how she tried to be worried about her health for so long, you know, but it, she's acknowledged that yeah, there's a lot of this that is excessive. And I think that's been hard for a lot of people to accept because they don't hear her explain it they don't hear us explain it they just hear,
 you know, she's doing something.
 You know, we know she's going to wear a mask, you know, all the time now around people, you know, we get that kind of stuff. But, you know, then I think there's also the extra stuff that is hard to accept because they're not hearing her thought process about it.
 And I think a lot of it is also, you know, during COVID for so long there's so much we didn't do, you know, and so much of what has become normal.
 It's just extreme, you know, out of the ordinary for us, especially, you know, Kelly, extreme, very unsafe. But these are things that's not just, you know, my family or Italian get together, you know, people are, you know, any, like, you know, things that are basically accepted as normal now, after a few years of COVID
 and I think that's something that in a lot of ways that you look at people not, you know, respecting their health or their safety, I feel like that is not fair.
 I think that's what makes it so difficult. It's really hard to separate between do people care about my safety and health, you know, are they understanding where I'm going through?
 Like she said, she's in a lot of this through me, she's in conversations she's having with me. You know, I think they've always been, you know, they've always asked and shown that they care about her in terms of her friends, you know, but I think the anxiety and all of the stuff that goes with it, to them, they have a hard time understanding no matter how many times I try to explain it in a way that, you know, trying to convey how
 you know, why things are the way they are, you know, how, you know, my mom has anxiety too, she's had panic attacks too, she's had a lot of, you know, things like that, there's, you know, things that they can relate to in certain ways.
 You know, I know, like she said, there's things that they probably gonna put it all on her in terms of, yeah, I can understand why she said she feels like it's her, you know, that would have to change the way she thinks.
 I feel like it's, you know, because we're the ones thinking and talking about this, you know, on our side of it. My parents can only know what they see on their end, and that lens is a lot smaller.
 I really used to work with what you can control, which is the two of you, and how you guys feel about it, and how you communicate about it, and when I heard you say that, I mean, like, you feel like the anxiety is a big piece of all of this.
 Absolutely.
 And, you know, that the anxiety's been there prior to all of this, like it's always the health and anxiety connection, and it's something that you've struggled with for a long time. Right?
 But yeah, you know, yeah, it wasn't getting better, you know, because situations that I was in, my anxiety just kept, you know, there was a reason why my anxiety was getting, was increasing, because, you know, the whole, all the events that have happened have just added to my anxiety, you know?
 And so, there was a lot of stuff with the family and so my anxiety just kept increasing, you know, and it wasn't feeling safe, you know, now looking back, like, it just, yeah, for whatever reason they couldn't accept that I had anxiety, because I think it was just like I mentioned before, it was negatively affecting them, where, you know, with Catherine's mental health and everything,
 that seems, and again, because I don't know all of that, but it's just, it's a different dynamic and it's a different level of acceptance. And where I'm painted as the bad guy and like I was, they've never, like, I don't know why Adam has to tell them so many different times, and they still wouldn't get it.
 And I think that's what's hardest, like I've just seen things, it's like, you know, actions speak louder than words, you know, like I've, you know, like he said stuff, and they just keep doing the same thing, they're not listening, or like he said stuff, and it's just like, you know, it's just a pattern that, you know, like, I just don't know why my anxiety was not accepted more.
 And why it was looked at so negatively and that's all I can think of is because it didn't play into what they wanted, you know.
 I just, I want to go to that too, it's not something that I've never, it's not like we asked the question, you accepted Keltie's anxiety. And it's, I think, when she says actions speak louder than words, it's looking at okay, what are the things that she can be stressed or anxious about, you know, feeling uncomfortable about, and the things that they're doing that are working against that.
 And I've tried to explain those things. And, but I feel like it's hard, it's probably hard for them because they, you know, I think, you know, like Kelly, you were saying, yeah, it makes things more difficult, it means that there's more that we can't do.
 But I would also say that it's basically just putting restrictions on a lot of like, you know, people we can see, things we can do, stuff we're willing to do, and how we're willing to do it.
 And to me, that's not really healthy. I feel like they probably see it the same way. I don't think it's a question of accepting anxiety or not, I feel like it's a question of, okay, you know, just a situation that we don't like.
 You know, it's been this way for a long time, it doesn't feel like it's maybe changing to them. Now, you asked before, would I want to go back to the way Kelly was where, you know, she was kind of like going through things going through the motions in her face.
 And definitely no, you know, because you can see how that has, you know, really damaged how she feels about, you know, these people and how it's so much so, you know, taken toll on her, like emotional.
 I mean, now she is, I think, feeling much better place, like emotionally, in terms of herself, of, you know, trying to do things to be healthy and, you know, handle her, you know, her stress level, emotional well being, and all things that try to like, you know, be in good place.
 And, you know, in some way. So I mean, totally see that, you know, it's been, you know, several years really working on stuff and trying to find that.
 And that a lot of times means, you know, you know, the things that she would want to be willing to kind of suffer through before that made her uncomfortable.
 You know, she's more less willing to do that. But, no, I don't want it to be the other way around.
 How's that feel for you in here, Callie?
 It's good, you know, I guess nice to hear that.
 Yeah, but he doesn't want me to go back to just stuffing it up, you know?
 Yeah. You know, like, I think it's interesting, like when hearing him say like, oh, I put on like restrictions and things, you know?
 But like now I'm seeing it as, yeah, it's like, well there's restrictions to his family.
 But now I'm like, that could also be like boundaries, you know, like healthy boundaries that I feel like I'm looking for, or that I'm a family member.
 So again, I just feel like with restrictions, like I was like, when I was here, we're not going to do this.
 It's just I'm a different person because I don't want to always be doing things with the family or always want, you know, stuff like that.
 So I just, you know.
 Yeah, no, good distinction.
 Were you referencing the past, Adam, like in terms of restrictions?
 Like, that's an interesting thing, what you're trying to understand that more.
 Yeah, I guess so. I mean, yeah, I clearly bring up a different thing.
 You know, I think it's, this is what makes it tough sometimes is how, you know, how you think about things.
 But I was talking about how, you know, I think when we would do things or in the past, there would be certain like, you know, I guess you could call it restrictions or boundaries.
 I don't know what the difference is.
 But one seems positive, one seems negative.
 But it's like rule setting, you know, and I can understand what it feels like.
 Okay, if someone's not accepting the rules I'm setting, they don't respect my boundaries, they don't recognize, you know, or me.
 Which is really tricky because it's like it kind of doesn't give you a voice, Adam.
 Yeah, yeah.
 At least I feel it.
 I think trying to degrade setting boundaries, I think that's totally healthy and I think your road into a better place is going to be new, establishing a voice and a way to, you know, participate in a way that feels safe and feels comfortable.
 Like that's great.
 But I also feel like Adam's kind of at a, it's like he can't really have feelings about it, you know, in some weird way.
 Like there's something that's like limiting for you when like you're allowed a voice too.
 I think my feeling is that if I don't accept that, then it feels like that, you know, Kelly said this before that like if I'm not understanding that, that she doesn't feel like she can trust me and protect or respect her, you know.
 And so to me, I'm like, well, these are things that she feels that, you know, are important to her core is that, you know, these boundaries are being accepted.
 But like you say, I'm like, well, I'm in a tough spot there because I have, you know, my thoughts too about what I feel is like, you know, valid, what I feel is, you know, good to do or not.
 And then, you know, so we're not seeing eye to eye on certain things and on the same page.
 To me, it feels like that the consequence of that is damage to our relationship.
 I agree.
 Yeah, like you both hold equal weight, hold your own perspective and be heard and validated and then try to come up with some sort of plan that respects each other, you know.
 So I guess the question is how to do that, you know.
 It sounds like.
 So I guess what's right now is, you know, Adam, do you feel that you are okay with Kelly, you know, staying out?
 Like, I don't know, I guess I'm just trying to like, go through what's not being said that should be said.
 You know what I'm saying?
 And like, it's okay to say it.
 It's not going to kill you guys.
 Like, you will not kill each other.
 Like, you have a foundation of a strong relationship.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I think, I mean, I think we're saying a lot.
 I, you know, I don't think there's something I'm thinking that I'm not saying.
 What I think the place we're in right now is, you know, today is showing me that it's not ready to go, you know, for Kelly to be in these situations, you know, because that's, she's not going to see it as a positive thing.
 She's going to see it as the unfortunate thing she's going through.
 And I don't want that, you know.
 Like, you know, so I think, I don't know, I think the thing maybe is that I, yeah, I don't agree a lot of times.
 I don't know a lot of times with what she feels, you know, I'm trying to support her and show her that I love her and I want her to feel like, you know, she's accepted and respected.
 And I understand, you know, that she feels like she's not in a lot of ways.
 I mean, I want her to be okay with, you know, if I'm not on the same page with her, it doesn't help me. I don't, you know, I'm not trying to understand, sorry, I love you, but I want to feel like I can have a difference of opinion sometimes.
 And not be like it's my responsibility to change and adapt to how she's thinking in order for us to refer.
 You know, I think it has to be, you know, both of us.
 Obviously, like the, you know, there's my point of view, her point of view, and then there's somewhere in the middle is, I think, you know, where things are, like the reality is somewhere, you know, and that means we both have to budge off things a little bit.
 I've been the one willing to, you know, move to wherever I need to be. And, you know, she's much more like, I mean, this is how I feel and I've been hurt for so long and I'm not going to try to move to something else when I don't feel like I do.
 And I think that's the hard part.
 Right, like in your work telling to move to a healthier thought that she's working on self care and that reason being, does that have to equal your position in regards to your family?
 Or does that involve real deep work around what your triggers are and what your plan is?
 Yeah, it just makes me like, you know, sad because it's like, it is such a huge thing where like if we're not on the same page, you know, about Dove and Abby and all that, it makes it just so hard.
 And it's like, you know, I do, I hate that he feels weak and I hate that he would feel that he has to like always give up so much for me.
 And I hate that like, I want him to be happy, but it's so, I think, hard for me to be more flexible and not so rigid, I think because for him, it's his family, you know?
 And so it's stuff that he's used to and it's his family and it's like kind of like, you know how sometimes when you're in a situation you don't always see it, you know?
 And so, and, you know, and I'm not, I'm trying to be so mindful of like talking about things in the past and kind of like moving forward but it's also like, I think it's important to talk about things that have happened in the past to get an understanding and a perspective of why I'm feeling certain ways.
 And, you know, for a while in the past, you know, Adam wasn't like noticing or seeing things, you know?
 And it could just be, I'm very perceptive and I notice all these things and, you know, that's just him as a guy.
 And like, you know, he has ADHD so he wasn't always, you know, like noticing or picking up on some things.
 And so it's so hard, I feel like, because I have been feeling so unfaithful and so hurt for so long.
 And I think, yeah, the most thing I've felt is just, you know, like what is, that's why it's led to my anxiety.
 I just don't feel safe.
 Over the years for so many different reasons and that's where it's like so compounding.
 It's because it's like, it's so overwhelming, it's because it's so many things, so much, and so it's hard, you know?
 It's hard for him because it's just, there's just so much.
 And it's like, and I just, I don't, I just, I don't know, it's so hard because I just feel like, yeah, for me,
 to just have a little of my sanity back, to not feel like I was the one that was crazy in this world.
 And that, you know, I just, I don't want to be, like, you know, guilt trips.
 I'm not cool with those, you know? Like I just, that's not healthy for me, you know?
 And like, I just, and like manipulation, like, I'm just like, I can't be,
 I feel like I just have to like really distinct myself and remove myself from like unhealthy behavior,
 like unhealthy boundaries, like manipulation, like I just, I feel a lot of that.
 And so it's just, it's hard because it's something that I struggle with, like deeply within all this, you know?
 What do you struggle with?
 That, that how I feel and see things with his family, that I don't think he sees it yet or will see it
 because it is his family and I get that, you know?
 But I just like feel like for me, I can't take part in the negative toxic aspects of that.
 So when you were referencing manipulation and guilt tripping, are you saying that that's something that Marie and Joe would do
 to try to get you guys to do things or is that what you're talking about?
 Yeah, yeah. I mean, there'd always be guilt trips, like come to these events, come to these events, you know?
 Like it's that family expectation, you know?
 And yeah, I feel like a lot of times there's this manipulation with a lot of things,
 probably more so Marie than Joe, but I just, I feel manipulation.
 Yeah, so so many things have brought up uncomfortable feelings for you.
 It sounds like, yeah, so yeah, it's easy to want to avoid it now.
 But I think like what we're gaining from this conversation is like, you know, that this is where you are right now.
 You had a success with Abby and that's good.
 But I think still having the conversation with her around what your journey is, I think will be very healthy.
 And if you were part of that, Adam, I think that's even better.
 You know, like the two of you coming in as parents for her, like not in a heavy way, but like in a united way, I think it's really healthy.
 And like also she's getting older. She's differentiating, you know, just developmentally.
 She's kind of entering into a different developmental stage.
 You know, she's going through puberty, figuring out herself and her identity.
 And I think the more you guys are aligned, the better it is for you and her.
 And, you know, so I mean, I feel like you discussed, you know, working on your anxiety and like, you know, how you've been affected.
 I think it will be a good step for you guys.
 You know, and I think it's also like acknowledging like it's great that you're making steps, but also working through the feelings, all these feelings that you do have here in this space and talking it through with Adam and feeling OK, Adam, to have a response.
 And that, you know, you can you guys can have feelings and they're all valuable, you know, and need to be fed because you don't say them.
 You're going to act it out. You know, you get passive aggressive or you withdraw or like that's just human, you know.
 Yeah, I just want to follow up on something Kelly said.
 So she, you know, we were talking about how being on different page on the suffer page and, you know, she mentioned about how and pass over this thing that she feels like I haven't seen.
 You know, maybe it was ADHD. Maybe it was because my family.
 I think that to me is just it goes against that feeling that my opinion, I can have my own opinions about things.
 You know, I want to be able to feel like, you know, she said something about like, I'm sorry he feels weak about this.
 I don't you know, I feel like I have these opinions and I've been had to be very strong in, you know, supporting her and also, you know, feeling like I also have my own voice in this.
 I've had to and I want us to be in a place where she recognized and acknowledges that my opinion might be have some validity.
 It's not just a matter of not seeing something or not paying attention or not wanting to see it.
 You know, I think, you know, and so part of that whole thing about maybe not being so rich or not, you know, being willing to move from compromising position a little bit means accepting a little bit of, you know, that my opinion could be valid too.
 And right.
 And I agree. Yeah. And I think also, I mean, I think this is like hard work, Kelly, because it's like working on the perspective and really trying to take that, you know, and also working on like, what are some ways maybe I can forgive or accept Joe and Maria or his family like, you know, that's the work you can do.
 Yeah. You can't be hustling to make them like you, you know, you work on liking yourself.
 Right. Yeah. So anyway, we are going to end.
 I'm going to see you both. Are you doing okay? I feel like that was like kind of a rough.
 I feel like every minute counts. I don't want to, you know.
 Yeah, no, they're okay. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. All right. So we'll see you guys on the seventh that one. Yep. Sounds good. Okay.
 Okay. All right. Bye.
 Yeah. Yeah. And an intense one. I know.
