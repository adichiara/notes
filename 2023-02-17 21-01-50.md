Automatically parse markdown notes for common words.

Generate new markdown files for each common word with links to notes. Like an index. 

Automate to do this daily

Include previews or first line of the notes in the index. 

Edit the note files automatically to turn common words into wikilinks to the index. 

Maybe this can be a GitHub action.
